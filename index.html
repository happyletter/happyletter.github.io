                Write and send your letter to someone!!
            </h1> <br>
            <p> In an age where we can send messages to each other from anywhere instantly, letters are slowly being forgotten. Handwritten letters take time 
                and money, but it is for that reason that we always put the most elaborate words into the letter. Happyletter is where you send your thoughts in letters to someone. 
                At Happyletter, you can only send one letter to one person per day, and the time it takes for the letter to reach the recipient will be one day.

                HOW TO SEND LETTER
            </h1> <br>
            <p> First, go to your mail box and click write letter. </p>
            <p> Then, write your letter and enter the recipient's address. If you don't 
                know anyone's address, you can send a message to someone randomly. 
                People who can receive random messages from strangers must turn on receiving messages from strangers in the user.  </p> 
            <p> Finally, put the letter in the mailbox, the postman will take a day to deliver it to the recipient. </p>
